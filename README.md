This app demonstrates a how-to list creation with steps that order themselves. It currently is in development, and the "remove" action on the steps does not work becuase I'm trying to do too much fancy javascript and keep the step CRUD on one page if possible. 
It will work out though. Until then, the list CRUD is functional, and everthing else works.
